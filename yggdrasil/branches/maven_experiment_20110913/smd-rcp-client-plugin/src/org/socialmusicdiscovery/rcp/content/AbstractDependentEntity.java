/**
 * <p>
 * The root abstraction of all elements that we edit as part of another element
 * in the client. The class implements a number of interfaces that are typical
 * for "secondary" client objects; these can be deleted, inserted and edited
 * only in association with class objects. They are not editor input elements.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One important purpose with this class is to allow separation of menus;
 * although these objects can be deleted, they are constrained in terms of
 * context; they cannot be deleted anywhere they are seen. Hence, they cannot
 * implement {@link Deletable}.
 * </p>
