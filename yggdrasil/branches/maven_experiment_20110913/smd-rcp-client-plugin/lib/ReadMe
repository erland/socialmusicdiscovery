Most external, third-party jars are fetched and placed (by Maven) in the target folder of the "dependencies" plugin , 
others (that are not readily available for Maven to download) are checked in in the 'lib' folder here. These 
components are either not available as binary downloads to Maven, or the availability of the component is unreliable.
This has typically been the case for Eclipse Nebula widgets, where the build system has been broken every now and then 
over the past years, including a period of almost a year when no binary downloads where available.
