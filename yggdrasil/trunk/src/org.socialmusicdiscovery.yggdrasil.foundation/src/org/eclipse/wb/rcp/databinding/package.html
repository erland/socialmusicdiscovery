<HTML><BODY>
<p>Provides some convenience classes for data binding offered by the UI design-tool (SWT designer). 
In the UI, they can be used to bind using "designer bindings" rather than "jface binding"; 
if they are not found, the UI tool generates these classes and puts them in the current package.</p>
<p>The value of these classes are yet to be determined, but they do seem to offer some handy features.
Let's keep them around for a while and see how they work out?</p>
