 * <p>
 * An abstraction of a UI to operate on an {@link AbstractObservableEntity}
 * using JFace data binding. Intention is to create both UI layout and data
 * binding using the <a
 * href="http://code.google.com/intl/sv/javadevtools/wbpro/index.html">Google
 * WindowBuilder pro</a> tool. For this to work properly, we must both observe a
 * few design constraints/conventions, and set the tool preferences accordingly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Design guidelines and tool settings will of course have to be properly described
 * at some point in time, but we're not there yet. Meanwhile, please consult
 * with the author if you need information on how to set things up.
