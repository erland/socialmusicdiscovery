<p>Keeping track of command id strings is a challenge. Many ways to do it. This is one:</p>
<ul>
<li>We keep all strings as constants on the handlers.</li>
<li>Each ID represents the name of the handler.</li>
<li>The handlers are named to represent the command they handle (there are no concrete commands except for declarations in meta data)</li>
</ul>
