/**
 * An "editor" for modifying existing instances, typically implemented as a
 * modal dialog. This is primarily useful for editing dependent entities that do
 * not implement {@link IEditorInput} and hence cannot be edited in a regular
 * editor. Implementers of this interface should typically be registered with
 * the extension point along with a declaration of the content type the dialog
 * handles. This way, the dialog can be "automagically" launched on selected
 * content by calling {@link WorkbenchUtil#openDistinct(Object)}, the same way
 * we open editors for {@link IEditorInput} elements.
