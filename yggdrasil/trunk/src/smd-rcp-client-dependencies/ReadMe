This plug-in is a container for all third-party components used by the RCP client.
In an RCP application, we cannot import regular jar files directly, they must be wrapped 
in and exposed as an OSGi bundle.

This plug-in serves this sole purpose; it holds all external (third-party) components we 
need, but no proprietary code.  

At the time of writing, all components here are downloaded in binary form from the original site.
It would also be possible to include components that were locally compiled in case the original 
is not available in binary form.
