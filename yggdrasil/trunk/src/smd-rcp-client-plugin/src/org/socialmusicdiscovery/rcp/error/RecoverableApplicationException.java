/**
 * <p>
 * A generic abstraction of expected application exceptions. Even in a bug-free
 * application, these exceptions may happen. Extending {@link RuntimeException}
 * to avoid polluting the code with checked exceptions, but we need to let
 * handlers distinguish between generic exceptions caused by programming errors,
 * and exceptions that we catch and re-throw. In the RCP application, a
 * proprietary {@link WorkbenchErrorHandler} can manage our specific errors.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When this exception is thrown, it is possible that the user can fix the
 * problem and retry the operation. For this reason, the constructor accepts a
 * user-friendly hint on how to handle the error.
 * </p>
