	 * <p>
	 * <b>Design note 1:</b><br>
	 * we need a specific collection type to make data binding easy; most/all
	 * data binding methods need to know if they observe a {@link List} or a
	 * {@link Set}. Implementers may return a {@link WritableList}.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Design note 2:</b><br>
	 * We could possibly return a {@link WritableList} to allow clients to
	 * modify children. However, current expectation is that children are often
	 * derived from "drilling criteria"; i.e. the list of children depends on
	 * what type of children the client asks for. Example: for a Release, the
	 * children may be Tracks, alternative Releases, Composers, performing
	 * Artists, or .. something completely different. Hence, the expectation is
	 * that returned changes are made elsewhere, and reflected in this set.
	 * Again: this is an expectation. Time will tell what we actually need. And
	 * as stated above, some implementers may return a {@link WritableList}.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Nonsense note:</b><br>
	 * As a parent, I find the name of this method quite amusing. I wish I could
	 * implement this In Real Life ;-)<br>
