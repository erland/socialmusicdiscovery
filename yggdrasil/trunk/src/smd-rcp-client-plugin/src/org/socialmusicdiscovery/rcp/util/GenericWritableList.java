/**
 * <p>
 * Neither the standard {@link IObservableCollection} interface nor any of its
 * subtypes or implementation classes are generic. Unfortunately, the Gson
 * serializer requires generic collections to instantiate, and we want to
 * convert standard collections into observable sets without this error:
 * <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Collection objects need to be 
 * parameterized unless you use a custom serializer. Use the com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken 
 * to extract the ParameterizedType.</code>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unfortunately, we cannot make this class behave in a "for each" loop since
 * the superclass implements a standard {@link List} (no generic parameter); we
 * cannot state that it implements <code>Iterator&lt;T&gt;</code>. Alas, to loop
 * over this list, caller must cast element type just as when calling the
 * superclass.
