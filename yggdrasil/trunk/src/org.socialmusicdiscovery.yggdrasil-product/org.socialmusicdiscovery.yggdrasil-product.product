         Welcome to SMD Yggdrasil ALPHA, an evolving rich client for the Social Music 
Discovery (SMD) project, built on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP).

The name Yggdrasil is taken from Norse mythology; it was said to be the 
world tree around which the nine worlds existed. Its branches extend far 
into the heavens, and the tree is supported by three roots that extend 
far away into other locations.

In SMD, Yggdrasil connects metadata in the music library and allows its
user to maintain both hard facts and subjective opinions about local or
online music. It is perhaps not the world tree around which everything 
revolves, but rather the view into this tree - the SMD repository - and the 
instrument for connecting the tree with heavens and other locations.

NOTE: Yggdrasil is in active development - many features are still missing!
