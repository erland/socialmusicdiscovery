About the target platforms:

The actual runtime platforms are built using Maven and Tycho, fetching the RCP bundles from a p2 repository. 
Maven also fetches a number of third-party plug-ins (with sources) and place these with the RCP bundles to form a target runtime platform.
  
Alas, the fetched RCP bundles hold no sources, nor do they hold any junit test classes, which makes it very hard to develop and debug.

The target platform definitions here include the Maven-produced runtime platform, and adds a few bundles from the p2 repository:
- Eclipse RCP SDK - holds the sources for all files, including the XML metadata for extension declarations 
- Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment - holds junit test classes to make the tests compile and run

NOTE: the development platform is "sloppy"; it includes more plug-ins than the actual runtime platform. 
There is also a risk for version mismatch between the Maven build and the local target definition.

We could manually strip the extraneous plug-ins from the definition, but the work to do (and maintain) this is bigger than the reward. 
 
Until further notice:
Code that compiles and runs in the Eclipse IDE is not guaranteed to run in the standalone client. 
Alas, the client must always be compiled and run from the command line to verify changes.
