#summary User Interface description

= Introduction =

The purpose of this page is to give an overview of the different user interfaces provided by SMD.

= User interface functionality per actor =
This section gives you an example what kind of functions each actor will be able to reach from the different user interfaces available. Note that this will just give you some kind of idea what kind of functionality each interface provides, all functionality available is not listed in this section.

For more information of the available actors, see the "[UseCaseModel use case model]".
