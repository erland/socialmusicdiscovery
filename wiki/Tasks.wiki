  * *Working on tasks*
    * Anyone that wants to work on something can assign an unassigned issue to themselves and start working on it.
    * When the implementation has been committed to svn or the documentation has been registered on the wiki/model or the analysis documented to the mailing list or wiki, change the status of the task to "Fixed".
