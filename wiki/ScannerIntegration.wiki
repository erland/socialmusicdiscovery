#summary Scanner integration

= Introduction =

This is a brief description of the current ideas regarding scanner integration. The purpose of the scanner integration is to:
  * Make it possible connect SBS standard tables with the Social Music Discovery database tables
  * Make it possible to import tag information into the Social Music Discovery database tables

The general idea during scanning is:
  # Standard SBS scanner will scan a music file
  # The Social Music Discovery plugin will get a callback after the track has been stored in the standard SBS database tracks table
  # In the callback, we will calculate a unique id for the music file. At the moment the plan is to calculate a SHA256 based on the audio bytes in the music file.
  # The unique id will be stored in the tracks table in SBS database in a new column

Questions to answer:
  # Should we use SHA256 for the unique id which is used in the relation between SBS database and Social Music Discovery database ?
  # If SHA256 is selected, which implementation should we choose ?
  # Should we use the interger based tracks.id column or the SHA256 column in database relations ? 
    # Do we even need to join between the different databases ?
    # Is there a difference in performance when joining integer columns compared to varchar(64) columns ?
  # How does an added track during SBS scanning affect our DB ?
  # How does a removed track during SBS scanning affect our DB ?
  # How does an updated track during SBS scanning affect our DB ?
