#summary About rich clients

= Introduction =

An important aspect of the Social Music Discovery project is that it should be easy to maintain the data, to handle this the plan is to create a rich user interface using modern technologies than just having a simple web based user interface. 

Information can of course be imported from external sources such as tags in the music files and online services but it should also be possible to edit and maintain the information about your music directly in the Social Music Discovery application.

The client part is separated from the server/database, the SMD server/database will typically run on the computer you are using for Squeezebox Server while the client can run on any computer in the network. 

= Multi platform client =

The first rich client we are working on is a multi platform client built on Eclipse RCP technology. 

The current state is that the core editors work with basic features. We still miss a few editors (notably Work, Label, Part and !RecordingSession), and a
lot of usability features (e.g. drag-and-drop, undo/redo, etc ). We also lack a consistent set of icons (current icons are just place-holders). After adding the
remaining editors for the core model, the next major step would probably be
to add support for the subjective model to make it possible to add/remove things like relations and classifications(genres, styles). 

We need more people who like to work on this multi platform client, so if you are interested in getting involved in this, please let us know.

If you want to try the multi platform RCP client at its current state, see more information on the [SoftwareInstallation installation instructions page]

Below follows some screen shots from the current state of the multi platform client:

= iOS client =

The plan is to create a native client for Apple iPad (and possibly iPhone/iPod Touch) to make it easy to discover music or do simple management of your music library directly from an iOS device. Maybe browsing related artist, change a classification, correct an artist name that have been spelled wrong or similar things.

The current state is that we haven't focused much on the iOS client so far but the plan is that it should use the same JSON based interface as the multi platform client when talking the the server/dataabase. We haven't decided if the iOS client will be an extension of one of the existing iOS apps or if we will create a custom one for SMD. If anyone is interested in getting involved in this already now, please let us know.

= Android client =

The plan is to create a native client for Android to make it easy to discover music or do simple management of your music library directly from an Android based tablet. Maybe browsing related artist, change a classification, correct an artist name that have been spelled wrong or similar things.

The current state is that we haven't focused much on the Android client so far but the plan is that it should use the same JSON based interface as the multi platform client when talking the the server/dataabase. We haven't decided if the Android client will be an extension of one of the existing Android apps or if we will create a custom one for SMD. if anyone is interested in getting involved in this already now, please let us know.

= Native Windows client =

Since most users likely are going to use a Windows computer when not maintaining the library from an iOS or Android tablet, we might need a native Windows client to make this an enjoyable experience. 

We have decided to wait a bit with implementing this, mainly because we have limited resources in the project, but also because we aren't sure how good the multi platform client will get. However, if you have experience of development on the Windows platform and would be interested in doing something in this area, please let us know.

= Clients for other platforms =

We haven't discussed clients for any other platforms than the ones mentioned above but this doesn't mean we aren't interested in this. If you would like to contribute to the project and make a client for your favorite platform/device, you are very welcome to join the project.
