#summary Notes on how to create extensions for the SMD Yggdrasil client.

The SMD Yggdrasil client is designed to leverage the Eclipse extension architecture. We hope that other developers will extend our initial platform by developing more or better plug-ins to enhance the client application. 

In time, this page will provide instructions for how to do so.

= WARNING =
*Yggdrasil is still unstable*

We do *NOT* recommend anyone to create any extensions yet.
