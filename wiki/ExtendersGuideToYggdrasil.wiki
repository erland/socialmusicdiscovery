#summary Notes on how to create extensions for the SMD Yggdrasil client.

The SMD Yggdrasil client is designed to leverage the Eclipse extension architecture. We hope that other developers will extend our base application by developing more or better plug-ins that to improve the end user experience. 

In time, this page will include a guide to help extension developers. For the time being, we do *NOT* recommend anyone to create any extensions to Yggdrasil.

= WARNING =
*Yggdrasil is still unstable!*
