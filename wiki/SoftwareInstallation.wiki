#summary Installation instruction

= Introduction =

There are a number of different options to install the SMD prototype as described below.

= Installation of SMD for beta testing =

The easiest way to install if you just want to beta test the software, is to do as follows. This is not the best way if you want to look at the source code or run the software in the debugger, but it's the preferred way if you are only looking for a way to get it up and running and do some testing.

  # Make sure [http://www.java.com/inc/BrowserRedirect1.jsp Java 6] or later is installed on the computer running Squeezebox Server
  # Configure one of the following alpha repositories in your Squeezebox Server in Settings/Plugins
    * Official tested builds: http://socialmusicdiscovery.googlecode.com/svn/repository/alpha.xml
    * Latest untested builds: http://downloads.socialmusicdiscovery.org/smd-plugin/svn-alpha-repository.xml

  # In Squeezebox Server inside Settings/Plugin, select to install "Social Music Discovery" which is available in the repository you just setup.

This will give you:
  * The SMD plugin installed into Squeezebox Server
  * The SMD Server installed into Squeezebox Server and automatically launched when Squeezebox Server is started:
    * It will use the MySQL database of Squeezebox Sever and store it's data in a "smd" schema if Squeezebox Server is configured to use its bundled MySQL database.
    * It will use a H2 database stored in the Squeezebox Server cache directory
  * The SMD Frontend can be launched from Squeezebox Server web interface from Extras/Social Music Discovery menu
    * The frontend is the simple Apache Pivot based version, it doesn't contain any management of data.
    * The Apache Pivot fronend is planned to be replaced with the [AboutRichClients RCP client] at some stage.

To start using it, you need to:
  # Start Squeezebox Server
  # Either perform a rescan in Squeezebox Server or goto "Squeezebox Server Settings/Advanced/Social Music Discovery" and select on of the "Import" buttons to import your SBS library into the SMD database. The progress of the import will be visible in Squeezebox Server Settings/Information.
  # After the import is finished you can
    * Through your normal Squeezebox remote or web interface goto "My Music/Social Music Discovery"
    * Through the Squeezebox Server web interface, goto Extras/Social Music Discovery and use the SMD frontend to:
      * Search for releases, artists or works
      * Double click on a release to see more details about the release
      * Single click on a release to see related artists and works
      * Single click on an artist to see related releases and works
      * Single click on a work to see related releases or artists

= Trying out the RCP Client =

The RCP Client isn't ready for beta testing yet but if you like to install the current version just to see how it looks like, you should do as follows.

  # Make sure [http://www.java.com/inc/BrowserRedirect1.jsp Java 6] or later is installed on the computer where you like to run the RCP Client prototype
  # Install the main SMD server and plugin as described in the above "Installation of SMD for beta testing" section
  # Download the RCP Client Prototype zip for your operating system from our [http://code.google.com/p/socialmusicdiscovery/downloads/list download page]
  # Unzip the zip and start the *launcher* which is found inside the eclipse directory in the zip.
    * Just hit the "x" to close the welcome screen shown initially
    * If you are running the SMD server/plugin on a separate server, you will need to goto *Window->Preferences->SMD->Server Connection* and specify the hostname or IP address of the computer where you are running the SMD server/plugin.

The RCP Client is in a very early stage at the moment, but you can try it out to get a feeling how a rich client will feel in comparison to the traditional web interface which Squeezebox Server is using.

We are currently in the process of moving the RCP client from being a prototype to something we are going to permanently include in the SMD project, eventually it's going to be available under the name *[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil Yggdrasil]*

= Trying out the UPnP server =

The UPnP server included in SMD is disabled by default, but if you like to try the current version just to see how it looks like, you should do as follows.

  # Install the main SMD server and plugin as described in the above "Installation of SMD for beta testing" section
  # Make sure [http://www.java.com/inc/BrowserRedirect1.jsp Java 6] or later is installed on the computer where you are running the web browser
  # In Squeezebox Server web interface goto *Extras/Social Music Discovery*
  # Wait for the smd-frontend to load, this will typically take some time the first time so don't be confused if you are only seeing a blank page initially and noting seems to happen.
  # Select the *Change configuration* button when the smd-frontend interface appears
  # Find the *org.socialmusicdiscovery.server.plugins.UpnpPlugin.enabled* setting and change its value to *true*
  # Restart SBS and when SBS and SMD is running again a new *SMD Media Server* should appear on your network.

The UPnP MediaServer is in a very early stage at the moment, but you can try it out to get a feeling how the SMD database can/will be exposed to any UPnP client you like to use.

Some things to note:
  * There is currently no support for playing tracks from the UPnP server, you can only browse the library
  * The UPnP server currently have incompatibility issues with some UPnP clients.
    * Look at the page [AboutUPnP about the UPnP server] for some information about which clients we have tried it with and know are working fairly good.
    * We know there are major issues with the [www.plugplayer.com OSX/iOS PlugPlayer app] and are working on trying to solve that.

= Installation for SMD Server development / debugging =

This installation is suitable for SMD Server development, if you like to change the SMD Server code or you like to run it in a debugger to see what happens.

Install the prerequisites which is needed to compile the server:
  * Maven: http://maven.apache.org/
  * Java 6 JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
    * The package under "Java Platform, Standard Edition" should be enough
    * After installation you need to setup a JAVA_HOME environment variable that points to the newly install Java 6 JDK

You now need to build both SMD Server and SMD Frontend
  * Check out the source code and build with maven
    * See the separate [BuildInstructions build instructions] page for more information about this

If you like the server to use a Squeezebox Server library, you also need to install the SMD Plugin in your Squeezebox Server
  # Configure one of the following development repositories in your Squeezebox Server in Settings/Plugins
    * Official tested builds: http://socialmusicdiscovery.googlecode.com/svn/repository/development.xml
    * Latest untested builds: http://downloads.socialmusicdiscovery.org/smd-plugin/svn-development-repository.xml

  # In Squeezebox Server inside Settings/Plugin, select to install "Social Music Discovery" which is available in the repository you just setup.
    * The development repository only contains the SMD Plugin without and server/frontend, so this installation differs from the above suggested installation for beta testing.

To start using you need to:
  # Open a new command prompt/shell and launch the SMD Server: java -jar smd-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    * If you are running Squeezebox Server on a separate machine (somehost), you can instead use: java -Dsqueezeboxserver.host=somehost -jar smd-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  # Open a new command prompt/shell and launch the SMD Frontend: java -jar smd-frontend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Now, you probably want to run the server inside your development environment so you can step through the code in the debugger, to do this you first need to install a Java development environment. The preferred choices are:
  * IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html
    * The commercial version of IntelliJ IDEA will of course also work if you have access to a license.
  * Eclipse: choose the most recent version, e.g. http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-37/indigor 
     * Note: If you also want to edit the RCP client code, please refer to the [http://socialmusicdiscovery.googlecode.com/svn/prototypes/ClientRCP_maven/smd-rcp-client-plugin/ReadMe.txt RCP Client ReadMe file].

You can generate project files with maven, see the [BuildInstructions build instructions] for more information about this.

To launch the SMD Server in the development environment, you just launch the class:
  * org.socialmusicdiscovery.server.business.logic.SMDAppplication

You can specify the -Dsqueezeboxserver.host JVM parameter when you launch it if Squeezebox Server is running on a separate machine.

As a suitable further reading, it's suggested that you take a look at:
 * [SoftwareSMDServer SMD Server design description]
 * Other documentation that might be of interest are:
   * [SoftwarePlugin SMD Plugin design description]
   * [PrototypeRCPClient Description of RCP client]
   * [SoftwareSMDFrontend SMD Frontend design description]
     * Note that this is just a temporary solution until RCP client is a bit more finished.

= Installation for SMD client development / debugging =

This installation is suitable for SMD client development. Since the Apache Pivot based frontend is just a temporary solution, it's not described here, instead this description focus on what's needed for the RCP based frontend called [Yggdrasil].

Install the prerequisites which is needed to compile Yggdrasil:
  * Maven: http://maven.apache.org/
  * Java 6 JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
    * The package under "Java Platform, Standard Edition" should be enough
    * After installation you need to setup a JAVA_HOME environment variable that points to the newly install Java 6 JDK
  * Eclipse for RCP and RAD developers: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-rcp-and-rap-developers/heliossr1 

You now need to build SMD Server
  * Check out the source code and build with maven
    * See the separate [BuildInstructions build instructions] page for more information about this
    * An alternative to building SMD Server, is to download the latest smd-plugin-full package from our download page: 
      * Official tested builds: http://code.google.com/p/socialmusicdiscovery/downloads/list
      * Latest untested builds: http://downloads.socialmusicdiscovery.org/smd-server/
      * You will need the smd-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar bundled in this zip file.

If you like the server to use a Squeezebox Server library, you also need to install the SMD Plugin in your Squeezebox Server
  # Configure one of the following development repositories in your Squeezebox Server in Settings/Plugins
    * Official tested builds: http://socialmusicdiscovery.googlecode.com/svn/repository/development.xml
    * Latest untested builds: http://downloads.socialmusicdiscovery.org/smd-plugin/svn-development-repository.xml
    * The development repository only contains the SMD Plugin without and server/frontend, so this installation differs from the above suggested installation for beta testing.
  # In Squeezebox Server inside Settings/Plugin, select to install "Social Music Discovery" which is available in the repository you just setup.

To start using you need to:
  # Open a new command prompt/shell and launch the SMD Server: java -jar smd-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    * If you are running Squeezebox Server on a separate machine (somehost), you can instead use: java -Dsqueezeboxserver.host=somehost -jar smd-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    * If you want an in-memory database filled with some sample data, you can instead use: java -Dorg.socialmusicdiscovery.server.database=h2-memory-test -jar smd-server-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

To build the Yggdrasil, follow the instructions described on the separate [BuildInstructions build instructions]

As a suitable further reading, it's suggested that you take a look at:
 * [Yggdrasil Description of Yggdrasil (rich client)]
 * [PrototypeRCPClient Previous description of RCP client prototype which now has become Yggdrasil]
 * Other documentation that might be of interest are:
   * [SoftwareSMDServer SMD Server design description]
