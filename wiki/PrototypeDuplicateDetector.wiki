#summary Duplicate Detector prototype

= General =

This is the "Duplicate Detector" plugin which is available in the following repository:
  * http://erlandplugins.googlecode.com/svn/repository/trunk/testing.xml

The intention of this plugin was to verify how good a MD5 calculated SMD identifier would work in comparison to a SHA-256 version.

This plugin has also been discussed a bit on the Logitech forums in the following thread:

The plugin source code is commited in our repository:
https://socialmusicdiscovery.googlecode.com/svn/prototypes/DuplicateDetector/

Regarding collistions, the current possibilities in the Audio::Scan library are:
  * Check the whole file (by using a large number)
  * Check only the beginning of the file
  * In 7.6 only: Check only a part of the file starting with an offset, this makes it possible to use the middle of the file.
