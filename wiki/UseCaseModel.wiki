#summary Use case model

= Introduction =

This is a model that describes all use cases involved in SMD.

Note that this is just a first preliminary version, so we have something to discuss around.

Some definitions/indications that might be good to know about:
  * *red color* - Indicates that this use case probably won't be included in version 1
  * *music entity* - A generic name for a song, album, work, recording, contributor or some other definition that is used to identify music
  * *contributor* - A generic name for all kinds of contributors on a song, such as artist, band, composer, conductor, performer

The make the model easier to understand it's divided into a number of sub models.
