	 * <b>Design note 1:</b><br>
	 * we return a {@link List}, not a {@link Set} or a {@link Collection},
	 * since we want the ability to modify the list - implementers may return a
	 * {@link WritableList}. We also need a specific collection type to make
	 * data binding easy; most/all data binding methods need to know if they
	 * observe a {@link List} or a {@link Set}.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Design note 2:</b><br>
	 * We could possibly return a {@link WritableList} to allow clients to
	 * modify children. However, current expectation is that children are often
	 * derived from "drilling criteria"; i.e. the list of children depends on
	 * what type of children the client asks for. Example: for a Release, the
	 * children may be Tracks, alternative Releases, Composers, performing
	 * Artists, or .. something completely different. Hence, the returned list
	 * is read-only; changes are made elsewhere, and reflected in this list.
	 * Again: this is an expectation. Time will tell what we actually need. And
	 * as stated above, some implementers may return a {@link WritableList}.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * <b>Nonsense note:</b><br>
	 * As a parent, I find the name of this method quite amusing. I wish I could
	 * implement this In Real Life ;-)<br>
	 * /Peer

	 * 
	 * @return {@link IObservableList}, possibly empty (never <code>null</code>)
