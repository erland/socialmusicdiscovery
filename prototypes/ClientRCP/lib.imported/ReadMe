A directory with "dynamic" libs, i.e. copied into this location (manually or by automatic build)rather than checked in to the source control system.
In time, the build system will dot this. For now, you need to have your own way of making this happen.

At the time of writing, what you need to do is to build the SMD server jar and place it (or a copy of it) in this directory. 
After this, you need to refresh the project to make sure Eclipse picks up the new version of the .jar.

Do NOT check in any files except this file in this directory!
