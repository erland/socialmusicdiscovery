Some VERY brief notes on how to setup and run the RCP prototype client.
 
1. Install Eclipse 3.6 for RCP developers: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/rcp.php 
2. Check out and build SMD code as described elsewhere
3. Launch client: right-click 'smd-rcp.product.launch' - 'Run As ...' - 'smd-rcp.product'

Optional:
- Install Eclipse Integration for Apache Maven (IAM) from http://www.eclipse.org/iam
