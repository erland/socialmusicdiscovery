 * A generic abstraction of unexpected application exceptions. In a bug-free and

 * Extending {@link RuntimeException} to let handlers distinguish between
 * generic exceptions caused by programming errors, and exceptions that we catch
 * and re-throw. In the RCP application, a proprietary
 * {@link WorkbenchErrorHandler} can manage our specific errors.
