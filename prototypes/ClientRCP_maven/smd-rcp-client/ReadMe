About the target platforms:

The runtime platforms are built using Maven. 
Alas, these hold no sources, which makes it very hard to develop and debug.

The "development" target platform includes the local installation AND the runtime platform, thus providing 
source code for Eclipse plug-ins and keeping the binary third party libs of the runtime platform (Google, Jersey, etc).

NOTE: the development platform is "sloppy"; there is no guarantee that the local plug-in versions match the runtime platform.
The local platform also holds quite a lot more plug-ins than the "naked" runtime. 
The development platform should ONLY be used while debugging or browsing source code to understand concepts.
It is provided "as is" as a temporary workaround until we find some way to build the true platform with source code attached.
